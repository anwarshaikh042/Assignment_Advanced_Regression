## General Information
The "Housing Price Prediction" project is a machine learning project developed as part of UpGrade's educational program.the Assignment should into two Parts.Part-I is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter Notebook), and Part-II includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file).
- Background
  A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- Business Problem
  You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
- Dataset
The project uses a dataset that includes various attributes and features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model, as it provides the necessary information to make accurate price predictions.
The specifics of the dataset, including its source, size, and attributes, are detailed in the data directory of this repository. You can explore the dataset and its details by referring to the project's Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
Accurate and data-driven housing price predictions can empower individuals and professionals in the real estate market to make well-informed decisions. The "Housing Price Prediction" project aims to contribute to solving this business problem by leveraging machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset.
